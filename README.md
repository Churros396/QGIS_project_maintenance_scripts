# QGIS_maintenance_Scripts
These short python scripts helped me maintain QGIS Projects via the Python Plugin. I worked with many layers with for which similar tasks had to be done. Created for QGIS 3.28.6.

currently avaible:
1. add_field.py: create a new field on multiple layers with a common prefix
2. update_value_map: 
   - your projects inlcudes forms to give fields values
   - the forms are created from a value map
   - use this script to update the value map from a excel file(as layer) for all layers with a common prefix

in developement:
- transferring features to other layer based on location
